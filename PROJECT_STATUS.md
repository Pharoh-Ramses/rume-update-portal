## 📞 Context for New AI Agent

This project is **ready for Phase 5 implementation**. All foundational work is complete and tested. The next agent should focus on building the core dashboard functionality that allows patients to interact with their billing information and choose between updating insurance or paying directly.

The authentication system is fully functional, the database is set up with sample data, and the UI foundation is professional and responsive. The project is in an excellent state to continue with the main patient-facing features.
